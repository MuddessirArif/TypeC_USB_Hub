## üîß Key Functional Modules

### 1. USB Type-C Audio + MIC Codec
- Integrated stereo headphone output and microphone input
- Codec supports USB Class audio functionality
- Perfect for headsets and voice-enabled embedded devices

### 2. 12V to 5V Regulator
- Based on AMS1117 or equivalent linear regulator
- Converts 12V input to regulated 5V for logic and USB components

### 3. USB Type-C to USB Type-A Converter
- Converts USB-C data to legacy USB Type-A interface
- Allows USB-C hosts to interface with USB 2.0/3.0 devices

### 4. LAN7800 USB to Ethernet
- USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet bridge (LAN7800 chipset)
- Adds networking to systems via USB-C port

### 5. 12V to 28V Boost Converter
- DC-DC converter to step up 12V to 28V output
- Used for actuators, motor drivers, or sensors needing higher voltage

### 6. 5V to 3.3V Converter
- LDO or buck regulator for supplying low-power 3.3V logic devices
